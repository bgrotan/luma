# Luma TODO file contains spesific things to do in the project tree.

+ Update all relevant parts of the application when settings are changed 
  through the settings dialog, (i.e. most settings in the dialog can also be 
  changed through menu actions)

+ Kill all threading activity against LDAP servers when quitting ?
  Perhaps with some sort of signal system.
  
+ Update the bin/luma startup script
