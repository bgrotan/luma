This module is an attempt to bring together the pieces needed for
creating a working Luma plugin.

To get dynamic translation support for the plugin, you are required to
implement the retranslate method and overload the changeEvent signal,
in order to catch the LanguageChange event. The retranslate method
should be called if this event is caught.

If your plugin is to provide some sort of settings management, you
must implement the writeSettings method in the SettingsWidget class, as
this method will be called by the Luma SettingsDialog when the save
action is triggered.

For more information on developing plugins for the Luma application, 
please consult the documentation, both available with the source
distribution and on the Luma website, http://luma.sf.net/ .
