Admin Utilities
---------------
    - Add support for nthash and lmhash
        Already implemented in the mkpasswd module but has a dependecy on module
        smbpasswd. Has to be incorporated into Luma so this module is optional.
        
        
        
Browser
-------
    - Add nice wizard to add new entries from templates
        Currently there is a usability problem with adding entries. The dn is 
        the one of the parent and many people forget to complete it with an 
        attribute of the new object.
        Also do not save, it not all must attributes are specified. Give a 
        warning.
