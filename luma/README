To install Luma, just execute the install script 'install.py'. You must give a
path as prefix. Example:

	./install.py --prefix=/usr/local

If you run the script without the prefix option, only some checks will be done.
This is useful, if you want to test if all needed software packages are
available on your system.

Thats all. Enjoy Luma! :)
