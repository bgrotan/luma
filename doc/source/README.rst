the application. Python is installed by default in most Linux distributions, and
can be downloaded from the official Python websit http://python.org/.


Obtaining Luma
==============
Documentation, usermanual and installation instructions can be found on the Luma
website http://luma.sf.net/. If you downloaded a source distribution of Luma, 
you can read the installation instruction in the INSTALL file.
