# This is a utility script to create the luma nroff manpage from reST.
# 
# It needs the docutils program rst2man in order to work.
# The script creates a standard .gz compressed manpage. To create a 
# manpage with a  different compression, just change the 'gzip'
# command. I.e. to  create a bz2 compression change it to bzip2.
