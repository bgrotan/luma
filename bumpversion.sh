Utility script for bumping the version of the Luma application.
Uses 'sed' to update the version variable in the version file.
The version string should be on the format:
 
    VERSION = 'version'

Where version typically is made up of version.release.modification,
i.e. 3.0.6.
"""
# The file(s) containing the version string
version_file="luma/__init__.py"
version_file_doc="doc/source/conf.py"
# The deployment script used to keep docfiles updated (html, dist)
deployment_script="doc/prepareDeployment.sh"

{
	cat <<-EndUsage
	Bump the version of Luma!
	
	usage: $0 [VERSION]
	
	If VERSION is missing you will be asked for the version.
	The new VERSION will be updated in two files:
	
	    $version_file
	    $version_file_doc

	NOTE: You must use a version number consisting of two or three
	dot-separated numeric components, as per the definitions found
	in the 'distutils.version.StrictVersion' module. See the module
	documentation for more information.

	The following are valid version numbers (shown in the order that
	would be obtained by sorting according to the supplied cmp function):
     
	    0.4       0.4.0  (these two are equivalent)
	    0.4.1
	    0.5a1
	    0.5b3
	    0.5
	    0.9.6
	    1.0
	    1.0.4a3
	    1.0.4b1
	    1.0.4
     
	The following are examples of invalid version numbers:
     
	    1
	    2.7.2.2
	    1.3.a4
	    1.3pl1
	    1.3c4
	
	NOTE: This script do not validate the VERSION number you provide.
	
	options:
	
	-h, --help   Prints usage and help.
	-d, --doc    Also generate the documentation files to reflect the
	             change of VERSION. This means running: 
	               
	EndUsage
